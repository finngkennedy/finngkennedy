            <h3><a href="4410_3.html">The Use of Pulsed NMR for Determination of Relaxation Constants</a></h3>
            <p>In this study, pulsed NMR techniques were used to generate
              spin echo signals from which relaxation constants were calculated.

            <h3><a href="4410_2.html">The P-N Junction and the Photovoltaic Effect</a></h3>
            <p>In this report, the IV characteristics of a Germanium p-n junction was measured, and the relationship of the photovoltage to intensity of incident light was verified. 
              Further, using semi-log methods, the carrier lengths and lifetimes of electrons and holes were estimated. Finally, also using semi-log methods, the quantity e/k_b was estimated.</p>

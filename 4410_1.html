<h1 id="introduction"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>Introduction</h1>
<p>Distance detection is a very important aspect of numerous electronics
systems. In fields such as robotics, distance sensors are often required
for systems to operate properly, as precise measurements are essential
for robots to map out their surroundings, avoid collisions, and navigate
through complex obstacles. Specifically, distance detection at multiple
angles is oftentimes necessary, otherwise robots may make flawed
decisions when determining the optimal turning direction in the presence
of obstacles.</p>
<p>While there are many ways to achieve distance detection, such as
LiDAR (light detection and ranging) or infrared sensors, one cheap and
effective method is an ultrasonic sensor. For robotics projects with
limited funding and resources, ultrasonic sensors are an effective
method for distance measurement, even though other methods may give more
accurate results. Ultrasonic sensors are also designed to easily
interface with Arduino boards, making them optimal for robotics
prototyping.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic sensors essentially work by emitting a high frequency
sound wave pulse, then recording the amount of time it takes for a
reflected sound wave to be detected. Internally, this works by driving a
piezoelectric crystal in the transmitter of the device with a high
frequency, oscillating voltage. The receiver, also a piezoelectric
crystal, converts the sound wave back into a voltage signal, which is
detected by the internal circuitry of the sensor. Then, using the speed
of sound, the flight time of the emitted wave is converted to a distance
using the following formula: <span class="math inline">\(d =
t\cdot0.0343/2\)</span>, where we account for the fact that the sound
wave actually has to travel twice the distance that was desired to be
measured<span class="math inline">\(^{[3]}\)</span>.</p>

doorway is a small hallway, with a wall approximately six feet from the
door. Right: A picture of the layout of the room showing the box,
doorway, and table.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite the complicated internal circuitry, the sensor remains cheap
at less than four USD, making it optimal for robotics prototyping or
demos. Furthermore, the small form factor of the device makes it
extremely flexible for use with motors, enabling detection that can
cover an entire 360 deg field of view, which is the main aim of this
project.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic sensors do have some limitations. Since signal detection
depends on the strength and quality of the reflected wave, object
detection will always depend on how well the sound wave is reflected.
Thus, objects that are slanted, rough, or absorb sound waves well will
have much weaker signals, introducing noise into the measurement and
possibly returning incorrect distances. Another subtle issue is that the
sensor will always return the distance corresponding to a reflection
from the closest object, regardless of whether that object is in the
same area the sensor points towards, a quality which we deem the
"nearest object" effect. Since the sound wave is really a plane wave
that emerges from the sensor, objects that are not directly in front of
the sensor can generate reflections that can give incorrect results for
distance. This result will be seen prominently in the data that was
collected. Perhaps the main challenge that emerged was the actual
attachment of the sensor to the motor. With more sophisticated
construction techniques, it should be possible to mount the sensor more
securely, however.</p>
<p>In summary, this paper examines the use of an ultrasonic sensor and
motor set up to get multi-angle distance measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the ultrasonic sensors as a very reliable, yet cheap and
easy option for sensing in robotics.</p>
<h1 id="experimental-methods">Experimental Methods</h1>
<p>In order to build a prototype multi-angle distance sensor, several
components needed to be acquired. On top of the Sparkfun HC- SR04
ultrasonic sensor itself, an Arduino Uno Rev3, an Adafruit Motor Shield
v3, and an Adafruit NEMA-17 stepper motor were needed.</p>
<p>The first challenge lay in the connection and calibration of the
ultrasonic sensor. This required the Arduino board to be interfaced to a
laptop using a USB B to C cable. Once the board is connected, users are
able to upload small programs to the board that can be written in the
Arduino IDE, which is free for download on the internet. Fortunately,
due to the popularity of the Arduino, there are many tutorials online
explaining how to use and program both the ultrasonic sensor and motor,
two of which were used in this project <span
class="math inline">\(^{[1,2]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, the user simply has to provide a
10 <span class="math inline">\(\mu s\)</span> pulse to the trigger pin
on the device. The integrated circuitry in the ultrasonic sensor then
provides a 40kHz oscillating voltage signal to the transmitter, which
emits the sound wave. The receiver then converts the reflected wave back
into a voltage signal, which is detected by the internal circuitry of
the sensor. The echo pin then emits a voltage pulse that lasts the
duration of the in flight time of the sound wave.</p>
<p>The Arduino was connected to the echo and trigger pins of the sensor,
also connecting the Arduino’s 5V and ground. Using the Arduino IDE, the
trigger pin was sent a 10<span class="math inline">\(\mu s\)</span>
pulse at 5V. The Arduino was then programmed to listen for a response
pulse from the echo pin and measure its duration. Once the sensor was
working properly, the device was calibrated by measuring distances at
intervals of 10 cm. The differences from the true values were then
analyzed using a curve fitting method from the scipy.optimize
package.</p>
<p>One main challenge in this study concerned the stepper motor. While
the motor can, in principle, be directly connected to the Arduino, the
large current requirements for the motor present a danger to the Arduino
and laptop. Thus, an Adafruit Motor Shield v3 was used to interface with
the stepper motor. Since the motor shield is actually inserted into the
Arduino such that it rests on top of it, the motor shield both protects
it, and allows easy access to the pins of the Arduino. Due to the
difference in power supply requirements for the Arduino and stepper
motor, the motor shield and motor were powered separately using a 12V
wall adapter, which plugged into the DC jack on the Arduino.
Importantly, the power jumper was placed over the two VIN jumper pins to
prevent a shorting from the power supply.</p>

</figure>
<p>The stepper motor was then wired to the M3 and M4 terminals of the
motor shield. The Adafruit NEMA-17 stepper motor is a four connection
bipolar stepper motor. In general, a bipolar stepper motor works by
alternating the current direction through two internal electromagnets.
The phase difference between the fields produced by the two
electromagnets causes the permanently magnetized rotor to orient itself
along the internal magnetic field, which can be changed in small steps
by the internal circuitry of the motor. In practice, the motor is
designed to be interfaced with the motor shield of the same brand and
packages that can be downloaded in the Arduino IDE make controlling the
motor extremely simple<span class="math inline">\(^{[4]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The sensor was then attached to the motor to enable multi-angle
sensing. This was perhaps the most challenging part of the project.
While the rigidity of the sensor-motor system can be unimportant over
small angle intervals, with 360<span
class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span> mapping, rigidity becomes very
important for ensuring accuracy in the angle of each measurement. For
instance, if the sensor is able to slip a small amount while rotating,
the angle the Arduino reports a measurement at can be vastly inaccurate.
While many options were explored to resolve this such as glue, rubber
cement, and string, the solution that worked the best was simply duct
tape wrapped very tightly around the sensor base, wiring, and the rotor.
The main reason the attachment of the sensor had to be so rigid turned
out to be the resistance to twisting from the wires needed to connect
the sensor to the Arduino. To solve this issue, the wires were attached
with tape to the ceiling of the wooden box the sensor rested in,
preventing them from catching on the corners of the motor during
rotation and allowing twisting with the least amount of resistance. The
set up is pictured in Fig 2E. After every scan, the sensor was rotated
back 360<span class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span> to minimize
twisting resistance.</p>
<p>Finally, the sensor was used to map a small wooden box in an
approximately <span class="math inline">\(11\times11\)</span> foot room.
The box, which is open on two sides, offers an opportunity for the
sensor to attempt to detect both short and long distances in each scan.
An approximate diagram of the room is provided in Fig 1.</p>
<p>The distance data was analyzed real time by the Arduino. The sensor
was either revolved at 1.8<span class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span>
per step or 3.6<span class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span> per step,
for a total of 200 and 100 steps per revolution in total. For most runs,
extra steps were taken to ensure that the sensor completed the full
360<span class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span> rotation. The angle of
each measurement was then slightly adjusted to account for the extra
steps needed to reach a full revolution. For each angle, twenty
measurements were performed from which a mean, standard deviation, and
standard error of mean were calculated.</p>
<h1 id="results-and-analysis">Results and Analysis</h1>
<p>The first experiment run concerned the calibration of the device.
Measurements were taken in increments of 10 cm, from 10 to 150 cm. For
each distance, 100 measurements were taken, from which a mean and
standard deviation were calculated.</p>

the true distance (horizontal).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 3 demonstrates how the sensor consistently underestimates for
increasing distances. Using this data, a calibration curve was generated
using a linear regression method from the scipy.optimize package.
Finally, the curve was used to correct the data taken in this study,
with the error in the calibration curve constants being propagated
through to the error in the final distance estimates.</p>
<p>Next, the test room was mapped, as shown in Fig 4a. Of note are the
two walls of the wooden box which the sensor rested inside, the table
across the room from the sensor, the doorway, and finally, a complex
experimental apparatus for studying the Zeeman effect that lies along
the right wall.</p>

<figcaption><span id="fig:wide" data-label="fig:wide"></span>Left:

class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span> scan. The same outline of the
features of the room in Fig 1 is provided here for context. Right: A
full scan that was able to detect the outer wall of the
hallway.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are several aspects of this data to note. First, there are some
obvious inconsistencies between the sensor and real space. Sharp corners
of objects continually represent an issue for the ultrasonic sensor,
with the returned value usually averaging to half the distance between
the edge and the wall behind with a large variance, an issue which seems
to be unresolvable and simply a quality of the sensor.</p>
<p>Another issue is that the sensor consistently measured
(unfortunately, over many trials) distances beyond the walls of the
room. One possible explanation for this stems from the nature of the
sound waves being used. Specifically, in the area around the Zeeman
apparatus in the top right corner, it is believed that the complex
geometry of the set up is preventing the sound waves from being
reflected back directly. This means that the reflected pulse that is
detected when the detector is pointing in this direction may have been
reflected multiple times off other objects in the room, making the
distance to the Zeeman apparatus appear much larger than reality. This
issue highlights another problem typical of the ultrasonic sensor: the
requirement of good reflectors for quality measurements.</p>
<p>One major triumph of the experiment was the ability of the sensor to
detect the hallway beyond the doorway in the top left. Though this
signal had an extremely large error, it sits right in the correct range
for the wall on the opposite side of the hallway. Furthermore, this
measurement provides an insight into a possible estimate of the width of
the sound wave emanating from the transmitter, a topic which will be
elaborated upon shortly.</p>

style="width:50.0%" />
<figcaption>A subset of the scan data from Fig 4a, showcasing the angle
range of the bowing effect. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the data concerns the “nearest
object” effect. While the sensor was extremely effective at detecting
the edge of the table at the top of Fig 4a, we noticed a slight bowing
effect on the data collected in this region. While logically the
measurements in this region should follow the straight edge of the
table, instead they appear part of a larger arc of a circle. This is due
to what we have deemed the “nearest object” effect: the ultrasonic
sensor will always return the distance which requires the emitted sound
wave to travel the shortest distance. Thus, even if the sensor is angled
relative to the table, it will still return the distance perpendicular
to the table. This is because a part of the sound wave reaches the
center of the table before the rest of the wave reaches the area in line
with the sensor’s true orientation. This is why the distances around the
table appear bowed: the sensor is reporting the distance perpendicular
for many different angles relative to the table. This effect allows a
unique opportunity to examine how large the emitted wave actually is,
giving insight into how effective the device can be at detecting objects
not directly in front of it. To the left and right of the table, two
points were selected where this bowing effect last reliably occurred, as
shown in Fig 5. From this an angle was calculated, representing the last
point at which the sensor still reported the perpendicular distance to
the table. This arc length was taken to be an estimate of the radius of
the sound wave as it passed the table, and was calculated to be: <span
class="math display">\[s=r\cdot\theta\approx 93.91 \pm 0.54\text{ cm
}\]</span></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The main goal of this study was to use an ultrasonic sensor to map
out a wooden box and testing room set up, which was partially
successful. The experimental setup was capable of faithfully reproducing
many aspects of the testing area. There were, however, numerous issues
with the mapping, mainly stemming from characteristics of the ultrasonic
sensor. For instance, the fact that the sensor uses the reflection of
sound waves to detect distances can introduce incorrect measurements due
to the “nearest object” effect.</p>
<p>Despite drawbacks, the ultrasonic sensor and stepper motor system has
proven to be an attractive option for robotics applications, especially
in the early design and prototyping stage. Specifically, for robots that
need to path find through complex spaces, ultrasonic sensors and stepper
motors can be effectively used to not only detect obstacles in front of
robots, but help determine which direction the robot should turn.</p>
<p>While the setup works well, there are several improvements that could
be made. One obvious improvement concerns the mounting of the sensor on
the motor. As mentioned before, the current mounting method results in
the true sensor angle lagging behind the recorded angle due to slippage,
requiring angle data to be corrected. In future iterations of this
device, the sensor could be soldered onto the motor or even machined to
ensure a good fit with high rigidity. Additionally, braided wires could
be used to connect the ultrasonic sensor, which would give less
resistance during twisting. Another possible refinement could involve
focusing the sound wave emitted from the sensor. Extending the metal
cylinder that surrounds the internal piezoelectric could reduce the
radius of the emitted wave, enabling more accurate sensing.
Additionally, this behavior could be modeled as a wave guide to more
accurately predict the behavior of the emitted wave.</p>
<p>In the course of this project, several key skills were acquired. The
Arduino itself is a highly versatile platform optimal for conducting
physics experiments. Learning how to use the system is undoubtedly
extremely helpful to anyone pursuing a career in experimental physics.
Learning how to design a system such as this is also a significant skill
in and of itself. As is so often the case in experiments, designing an
experimental apparatus takes time, effort, and significant patience.
Lastly, understanding the mechanics of sound waves and the complex ways
in which they can reflect and give strange distance measurements is
useful for future experiments with other types of waves.</p>

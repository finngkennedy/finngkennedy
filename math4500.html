</header>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-generalized-orthogonal-group-opq">The
generalized orthogonal group, O(p,q)</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The group O(p,q) is defined as the set of all real matrices that
preserve the following symmetric bilinear form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(x,y)_{pq} = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + ... +
x_py_p - x_{p+1}y_{p+1} - ... - x_{p+q}y_{p+q}\]</span></p>
<p>Which means that for all <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda \in
O(p,q)\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(\Lambda x,\Lambda y)_{pq} =
(x,y)_{pq}\]</span></p>
<p>Or, equivalently,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(x,y)_{pq} = x^T\eta y = (x,\eta
y)\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is an <span
class="math inline">\((p+q)\times(p+q)\)</span> diagonal matrix with
<span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>’s for the first p diagonal
entries, and <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>’s for the next q
entries. This implies the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(x,\eta y) = (\Lambda x,\eta\Lambda y) =
(x,\Lambda^T\eta\Lambda y) \implies \Lambda^T\eta\Lambda =
\eta\]</span></p>
<p>From which follows: <span class="math inline">\(\det(\Lambda) =
\pm1\)</span>, as <span
class="math inline">\(\det(\Lambda^T)\det(\eta)\det(\Lambda) =
\det(\eta)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\det(\Lambda)^2 =
1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Special generalized orthogonal group, SO(p,q) is likewise defined
as the subgroup of O(p,q) with <span
class="math inline">\(\det=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary: <span class="math display">\[O(p,q) = \{\Lambda\in
GL(p+q,R) | \Lambda^T\eta\Lambda=\eta \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[SO(p,q) = \{\Lambda\in O(p,q) | \det(\Lambda)=1
\}\]</span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="topology">Topology</h2>
<p>When p and q are both non-zero (otherwise we are simply dealing with
the orthogonal group), O(p,q) has four distinct, disconnected
components. These four components correspond to preserving or flipping
orientation on the p and q dimensional subspaces O(p,q) acts on.</p>
<p>To see why this is the case, consider the maximal compact subgroup of
O(p,q) = <span class="math inline">\(O(p)\times O(q)\)</span>. This
subgroup will have the same number of connected components as the group
O(p,q). Since O(p) and O(q) are both not connected, having both two
connected components each (corresponding to the +1 and -1 determinants),
the total number of connected components of O(p,q) will be four, given
<span class="math inline">\(p,q\neq 0\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(^{[8]}\)</span>.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="lorentz-group">Lorentz group</h1>
<p>In special relativity, the speed of light, c, is said to be the same,
regardless of inertial reference frame. So, given two reference frames,
<span class="math inline">\((t,x,y,z)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((t&#39;,x&#39;,y&#39;,z&#39;)\)</span>, any event,
or spacetime vector, will have the same magnitude in either reference
frame<span class="math inline">\(^{[2]}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c^2t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2 = c^2t&#39;^2 -
x&#39;^2 - y&#39;^2 - z&#39;^2\]</span></p>
<p>Where the speed of light remains constant in both frames. Because
this condition is the same as preserving the bilinear form Q:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(t,x,y,z)\mapsto
t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2\]</span></p>
<p>The Lorentz group is defined as O(1,3), the group which preserves Q,
or alternatively, which preserves distance in Minkowski spacetime,
written as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The four components of the Lorentz group can be understood in terms
of whether or not a given transformation flips the orientation of the
space and/or time dimensions. Transformations which preserve the
direction of the time axis are called orthochronous, and those which
preserve spatial orientation are called proper. The component of the
Lorentz group which is both proper and orthochronous is deemed the
restriced Lorentz group, <span class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span>,
and is the largest subgroup of the Lorentz group, as it contains the
identity.</p>
<p>The rest of this paper deals with the restricted Lorentz group, which
is often just called the Lorentz group for brevity.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="lie-algebra-and-generators">Lie algebra and
Generators</h1>
<p>First, an aside on the lie algebra of the Lorentz group.
Understanding the Lie algebra will be important for understanding why
the double cover of the restricted Lorentz group has two nonequivalent
irreducible representations, which will correspond to left and right
chiral spinors in physics.</p>
<p>The Lie algebra is calculated by taking some path A(t) in the Lorentz
group such that A(0) = I, and the derivative of the path <span
class="math inline">\(A&#39;(t) = X\)</span>. Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A(t)^T\eta A(t) = \eta\]</span></p>
<p>Differentiating, and using the product rule:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dt}(A(t)^T\eta A(t)) =
A&#39;(t)^T\eta A(t) + A(t)^T\eta&#39;A(t) + A(t)^T\eta A&#39;(t) =
\frac{d}{dt}(\eta)\]</span></p>
<p>Noticing <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>’ = 0, because it
is a constant matrix, and setting t = 0:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A&#39;(t)^T\eta A(t) + A(t)^T\eta
A&#39;(t) = 0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X^T\eta+\eta X = 0\]</span></p>
<p>And, noticing that <span class="math inline">\(\eta =
\eta^{-1}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathfrak{so}(3,1) = \{X\in
M(p+q,\mathbb{R}) | \eta X\eta = -X^T\}\]</span></p>
<p>The matrices that satisfy this equation are of the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; a &amp; b &amp; c \\
    a &amp; 0 &amp; d &amp; e \\
    b &amp; -d &amp; 0 &amp; f \\
    c &amp; -e &amp; -f &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the coefficients a,b,c,d,e,f correspond to the six basis
vectors of our tangent space. The a,b,c matrices are renamed <span
class="math inline">\(K_1,K_2,K_3\)</span>, and the d,e,f are renamed
<span class="math inline">\(J_1,J_2,J_3\)</span>, as is convention. When
exponentiated back into the Lorentz group, these represent the
generators of the group, which correspond to spacetime rotations (the
J’s), and Lorentz boosts, or hyperbolic rotations (the K’s)<span
class="math inline">\(^{[4]}\)</span>.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-double-cover-of-so13">The double cover of
<span class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span></h1>
<p>In quantum mechanics, the mapping <span
class="math inline">\(\varphi:SL(2,\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow
SO^+(1,3)\)</span> is of particular importance. The following is a proof
that this homomorphism is a surjective 2-1 mapping, and thus that <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> is the double cover of
<span class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span>. In fact, <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> is the universal
covering group of <span class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span>, and is
isomorphic to the group <span
class="math inline">\(Spin(1,3)\)</span></p>
<p>To investigate this, a homomorphism between the two groups must be
defined. <span class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> acts on
the space of <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> complex
matrices, so if we can identify a basis in this space that is isomorphic
to Minkowski space, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\)</span>, we can classify which
matrices in <span class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> should
act in the same way as the Lorentz group on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\)</span>. The basis is
constructed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X = \begin{pmatrix}
    t + z &amp; x-iy \\
    x+iy &amp; t-z  \\
\end{pmatrix} \longleftrightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}
    t &amp; x &amp; y &amp; z
\end{pmatrix} = \vec{x}\]</span></p>
<p>Where it is noted that: <span class="math display">\[\det(X) =
(\vec{x},\vec{x}) = t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2\]</span> Meaning that the Minkowski
bilinear form is preserved in our representation of the vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{x}\)</span> in the space of <span
class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> complex matrices. Notice that
this basis is really the Pauli matrices:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1  \\
\end{pmatrix} \ \sigma_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 0  \\
\end{pmatrix} \ \sigma_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; -i \\
    i &amp; 0  \\
\end{pmatrix} \ \sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -1  \\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Matrices <span class="math inline">\(S\in\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> transform vectors X as:
<span class="math inline">\(X \mapsto SXS^\dagger\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> is faithful to the
Lorentz group, then conjugation by these matrices should preserve
determinant as Lorentz transformations preserve the bilinear form. This
is true because all matrices in <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> are <span
class="math inline">\(\det(S) = 1\)</span>, and therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\det(SXS^\dagger) =
\det(S)\det(X)\det(S^\dagger)= \det(X)\]</span></p>
<p>To make this more explicit, we can write a Lorentz transformation:
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{x&#39;} = \Lambda \vec{x}\)</span> in
terms of a transformation S in <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span>. Notice that <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_n\sigma_m\neq0\)</span>, so we must reason
another way of defining an inner product.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(\sigma_n,\sigma_m) =
\frac{1}{2}Tr(\sigma_n\sigma_m)\]</span></p>
<p>Using the trace of the product of two matrices as the inner product
on our "vector" space works well, as <span
class="math inline">\((\sigma_n,\sigma_m)=\delta_{mn}\)</span>.
Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;_n = (S X S^\dagger,\sigma_n) =
\frac{1}{2}Tr(S \sigma_m S^\dagger\sigma_n)x_m  = \Lambda
\vec{x}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, it is obvious that <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> is the double cover of
<span class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span>, as the matrices <span
class="math inline">\(\{+S,-S\}\)</span> both map to the same <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. Furthermore, the kernel,
Ker<span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>, or all matrices S that
map to the identity in <span class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span>,
is <span class="math inline">\(\{+I,-I\}\)</span>, as the only value of
S that make the matrix <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}Tr(S
\sigma_m S^\dagger\sigma_n) = I\)</span> are S = <span
class="math inline">\(\{+I,-I\}\)</span>, in which case <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}Tr(S \sigma_m S^\dagger\sigma_n) =
\frac{1}{2}Tr(\sigma_m\sigma_n) = \delta_{nm} = I\)</span>.</p>
<p>This mapping is surjective, as it can be shown that every basis
element of <span class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span> has a
corresponding matrix in <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, by the first isomorphism theorem, <span
class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3) \cong SL(2,\mathbb{C})/\{\pm
I\}\)</span>. Furthermore, because <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> is connected, we can say
that it is the universal covering group of <span
class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span>, and therefore, <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\cong Spin(1,3)\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(^{[3,4]}\)</span></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="a-not-so-brief-discussion-of-representations">A not so brief
discussion of representations</h1>
<p>In quantum field theory, representations of groups are very
important. This is because, in general, wave function solutions should
be invariant under transformations by certain groups. This basically
means that the laws of physics should be the same no matter where you
are. A certain representation of a group is defined as the way the group
acts upon a vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, or
specifically, the map <span class="math inline">\(\varphi: G \rightarrow
GL(V)\)</span>, where we essentially are choosing a way to describe the
group as a matrix. If we instead wish for a description of the group on
the vector space <span class="math inline">\(V^*\)</span>, the matrices
representing the group G will in principle not be the same. In QFT,
these different possible vector spaces are taken to be solution spaces
for a particles wave function. So, if a wave function is invariant under
a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, then there exist
solutions to the wave functions in all the vector spaces of its
irreducible representations, then, in principle, it is possible to
describe how the irreducible representations would act differently on
the same vector space, and thus correspond to different possible
particle states.</p>
<p>We seek to do this for the double cover of <span
class="math inline">\(SO^+(1,3)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span>, as the wave function of
a particle in quantum mechanics is defined with complex coefficients,
and thus requires a representation of the group in complex space. In
general this process can be fairly difficult, however, for simply
connected matrix Lie groups (which <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> is), there is a one to
one correspondence between representations in the Lie group and
representations in the Lie algebra<span
class="math inline">\(^{[1]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful theorem, that makes identifying
representations much easier. If we notice that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C}) = \{X \in
M(n,\mathbb{C}) | Tr(X) = 0\}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\mathfrak{su}(2) = \{X \in M(n,\mathbb{C}) | X +
X^\dagger = 0, Tr(X) = 0\}\]</span></p>
<p>We can then write some matrix X in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X = \frac{X - X^\dagger}{2} + i\frac{X +
X^\dagger}{2i}\]</span></p>
<p>Redefining the first term as <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>
and the second as <span class="math inline">\(iX_2\)</span>, we can see
that both <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> satisfy the relations of the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{su}(2)\)</span> Lie algebra. We can then
see that<span class="math inline">\(^{[7]}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C}) \cong
\mathfrak{su}(2)\times\mathfrak{su}(2)\]</span></p>
<p>This is an extremely powerful statement, because we can now see that
irreducible representations in <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> are simply going to be
the combinations of the irreducibles of <span
class="math inline">\(SU(2)\)</span>, due to the one to one
correspondence between representations of a group and its Lie algebra.
That is, for two representations <span
class="math inline">\((\pi_{s_1},V^{s_1})\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\((\pi_{s_2},V^{s_2})\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(SU(2)\)</span>, an irreducible representation of
<span class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> will be given
by<span class="math inline">\(^{[4]}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[(\pi_{s_1}\otimes\pi_{s_2},V^{s_1}\otimes
V^{s_2})\]</span></p>
<p>We will be most interested in the two representations: <span
class="math inline">\((\frac{1}{2},0)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((0,\frac{1}{2})\)</span>, which correspond to the
representations which act on the left and right handed Weyl spinors.</p>
<p>It will now be useful to understand how the two representations act
differently on the same vector space. Schur’s first lemma states that
two matrix representations, <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_1(g)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_2(g)\)</span>, are equivalent if there exists
a matrix A such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi_1(g) = A^{-1}\pi_2(g)A\]</span></p>
<p>Given our first representation S of <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span>, the only other matrix
form that is not "reachable" by conjugation of A will be <span
class="math inline">\((S^\dagger)^{-1}\)</span>, as conjugation by A will
not change the eigenvalues of the matrix S, but complex conjugation
can<span class="math inline">\(^{[4]}\)</span>. This is in contrast to
<span class="math inline">\(SU(2)\)</span>, which has entirely real
eigenvalues, meaning the complex conjugate of any matrix in <span
class="math inline">\(SU(2)\)</span> is an equivalent
representation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in general, when there are two irreducible
representations for a group over complex space, and one is given by
<span class="math inline">\(\Pi(g)\)</span>, the other, <span
class="math inline">\(\Pi^*(g)\)</span> = <span
class="math inline">\(\Pi(g^{-1})^\dagger\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(^{[1]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This means that in <span
class="math inline">\(SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span>, left spinors and right
spinors will transform as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\psi&#39;_L = S\psi_L\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\psi&#39;_R = (S^\dagger)^{-1}\psi_R\]</span></p>
<p>Physicists typically reach this result by looking at the parity
transformations of representations of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz
group, with the idea that parity will flip one irreducible to its dual.
Importantly, parity leaves rotations invariant, but flips the signs of
Lorentz boosts. Exponentiating the parity transformed Lie algebra basis
back into the group yields <span
class="math inline">\((S^\dagger)^{-1}\)</span> in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(S \in SL(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span>, as in the above
relationship. This is analagous to constructing the dual representation
using the complexification of the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{so}(3,1) \cong
\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})\)</span> algebra.<span
class="math inline">\(^{[5]}\)</span></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-dirac-equation-and-weyl-spinors">The
Dirac Equation and Weyl spinors</h1>
<p>Using the language of left and right spinors, the Dirac equation can
be derived. First, we start by defining a Dirac spinor, which is simply
the direct sum of the left and right representations.<span
class="math inline">\(^{[6]}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Psi&#39; = D(S)\Psi\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\Psi = \begin{pmatrix}
    \psi_L \\
    \psi_R
\end{pmatrix} \; D(S) = \begin{pmatrix}
    S &amp; 0  \\
    0 &amp; (S^\dagger)^{-1}
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Typically, in a well behaved quantum system we can immediately start
taking inner products and expectation values, however, because of our
two irreducible representations, <span class="math inline">\(D(S)^\dagger
D(S) \neq 1\)</span> typically. Therefore in order to correspond this
representation to real world measurements, a new inner product has to be
defined. To do this we have to introduce the gamma matrices (or Dirac
matrices). Following [5], the Dirac adjoint is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{\psi} = \psi^\dagger
\gamma_0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\gamma_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; I_2 \\
    I_2 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\psi}\psi\)</span> is a scalar
quantity, a Lorentz scalar, invariant under Lorentz transformations. The
rest of the gamma matrices are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\gamma_i = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; \sigma_i \\
    -\sigma_i &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i\)</span> is the i’th Pauli
matrix. The gamma matrices are technically the Clifford algebra,
Cliff<span class="math inline">\((1,3)\)</span>, which satisfy the
anti-commutator relation: <span
class="math inline">\(\{\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu\}=2\eta\)</span>.</p>
<p>By reasoning of the Lorentz scalar, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\psi}\gamma_\mu\psi\)</span> is called a
Lorentz vector, and is also invariant to Lorentz transformations. Note
that identification of these matrices allows us to write any vector in
Minkowski spacetime as (introducing Feynman slash notation):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\slashed{x} = t\gamma_0 + x\gamma_1 +
y\gamma_2 + z\gamma_3\]</span></p>
<p>Which shows the connection between our description of the double
cover of the Lorentz group and our new representation on the Dirac
spinors. The Minkowski norm, Q, is preserved as <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_0^2 = 1\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_i^2 = -1\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(i = 1,2,3\)</span>. Our representation in the
Dirac spinor space is just the tensor product of our two irreducible
representations, with the <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>
matrices serving as the Pauli matrices of both at the same time.</p>
<p>Now, to get the dirac equation, we attempt to write a Lorentz
invariant action (where the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> has
become a superscript of the <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>
matrices to satisfy contravariance and covariance):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int dx^4
\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi\]</span></p>
<p>Where the Lagrangian density in the integral is found from assuming
there is a square root of the Klein-Gordon equation. We can now show
that this Lagrangian is Lorentz invariant:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L} =
i\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi- \bar{\psi}m\psi\]</span></p>
<p>By noting that both terms are either Lorentz scalars or vectors(when
contracted over the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> indices,
<span class="math inline">\(\partial\)</span> is is a scalar quantity
multiplying the <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> matrices),
which are invariant under the action of the Lorentz group. Then:
variation of the lagrangian with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> yields <span
class="math inline">\(^{[6]}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi =
0\]</span></p>
<p>The Dirac equation. Written using Feynman slash notation, where <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> matrices are contracted into the
differential:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(i\slashed{\partial}-m)\psi =
0\]</span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="importance-of-the-dirac-equation">Importance
of the Dirac Equation</h2>
<p>The Dirac equation is one of the most important results in physics.
Solutions to the Dirac equation describe all spin <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> particles. Furthermore, when
these particle fields are quantized, which was not done here, both
matter and anti-matter solutions are found. Using this equation, Dirac
correctly predicted anti-matter years before it was experimentally
confirmed.</p>

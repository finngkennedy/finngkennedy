<h1 class="title">Simulation of CrI<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> in the Ising Model Using the
Monte-Carlo Method</h1>
<p class="author">Finn Kennedy</p>
<p class="date">December 2024</p>
</header>
<p> Submitted this for my computational physics final project. I spent less time on the
  writeup than I would have liked to, so I may go back and edit this more. I also remember 
  seeing that a good way to extract the curie temperature is to take the numeric derivative
  of the M vs. T plot. There should be a sharp peak at the curie temperature, but with some variance.
  This plot could be fit to some kind of gaussian and you could extract an exact estimate for the curie temp
  along with an error. This wouldn't take long so I may add it to the code. Additionally my code was kind of 
  dumb in that I regenerated the graphs from simulation every time instead of just saving the data to 
  process after, but I wasn't doing any actually data analysis of the plots, so that wasn't huge. 
  I'll try and add this into the code, which I'll post on my github. Finally, I plan to come back 
  and do a full derivation of the M vs. H curve.
</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Monte-Carlo method is an extremely useful computational method
that takes advantage of randomness to calculate anything from integrals
to financial models. Here, the method is used to simulate a 2D lattice
of atoms under a perpendicularly applied magnetic field, each with one
unpaired electron. The electrons are free to orient their spin in the
orientation of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>We know from electrodynamics that the energy of a dipole <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{m}\)</span> in a magnetic field, <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{B} = B\hat{z}\)</span>, is <span
class="math inline">\(U = -\boldsymbol{m}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}\)</span>.
So, if <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{m}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{B}\)</span> point in the same
direction, the energy will be the most negative, and thus in the most
stable configuration. In fact, there is another contribution to the
energy of the lattice: the spin exchange interaction. If we assume that
one of the spins is already pointing in the <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span> direction, then the B field due
to that dipole will be given by<span
class="math inline">\(^{[4]}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boldsymbol{B_{dip}(r)} = \frac{\mu_0
m}{2\pi r^3}\hat{z}\]</span></p>
<p>Then, a configuration with another neighboring spin, with magnetic
dipole <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{m}\)</span>, will again
have energy <span class="math inline">\(U =
-\boldsymbol{m}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}\)</span>, and U will be minimized
when the spins point in the same direction. Logically, it follows that a
2D lattice in a magnetic field would be in its ground state when all of
the spins align with the magnetic field. Of course, this is a simplified
version of reality: an anti ferromagnet will prefer spins to actually
point against each other, in an alternating fashion, though this is not
investigated here.</p>
<p>The energy of the lattice will then be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E = -J\sum_{i}\sum_{j \text{
nearest}}\boldsymbol{s_i}\cdot \boldsymbol{s_j}
-\sum_{i}g\mu_b\boldsymbol{s_i}\cdot \boldsymbol{B}\]</span></p>
<p>Where, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{s_i}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{s_j}\)</span>, are the magnetic
dipoles of the ith and jth spin. J is the exchange interaction constant,
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_b\)</span> is the Bohr magneton, and g
is the gyromagnetic ratio. Since the <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{s_i}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{s_j}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{B}\)</span> are all set to point in
the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span> direction, <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{s_i}\)</span> is simply taken to be 1
or -1 for spin up and spin down, respectively. From now on <span
class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> is taken to be a scalar with these
values. Since the dipole magnetic field drops off with <span
class="math inline">\(r^3\)</span> it is reasonable to assume that only
nearest neighbors have a significant effect on the energy of any one
spin.</p>
<h1 id="theory-of-the-ising-model">Theory of the Ising Model</h1>
<p>But, first, an introduction to the 2D Ising model. The actual
derivation of the predictions of the model would take many many pages,
so it is simply summarized here, the important parts of which are the
Curie temperature and the magnetic hysteresis curve.</p>
<p>The most important part of the derivation involves using the
Bragg-Williams approximation, which estimates the number of nearest
neighbor interactions between like spins in terms of the total number of
those spins. Using this approximation, the canonical partition function
of the system can then be written in terms of one sum, which allows the
method of maximum term to be used. The result of these steps is the
following transcendental equation which must be solved graphically:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L = \tanh(\frac{\mu_m}{k_bT}B +
\frac{\gamma J}{k_bT}L)\]</span></p>
<p>The solution for this equation is given below for T <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> 0 in Figure 1. For T <span
class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 0, the solution approaches that
of a box centered on the origin. Meaning there is some <span
class="math inline">\(|B_c|\)</span> at which the B field will cause all
of the spins to flip at once in an abrupt phase change<span
class="math inline">\(^{[6,10]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As temperature keeps increasing, however, the solution will change
drastically. The Curie temperature <span
class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> is defines as (where <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the number of nearest
neighbors):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_c = \frac{\gamma J}{k_b}\]</span></p>
<p>and is the point at which the solution for L changes from trivial to
unique:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L = 0 \text{  }(T &lt; \frac{\gamma
J}{k_b})\]</span> <span class="math display">\[L =
\begin{cases}
    -L_0 &amp;  \\
    0 &amp;  \\
    L_0 &amp;
\end{cases}
(T &gt; \frac{\gamma J}{k_b})\]</span></p>
<p>This means that when <span class="math inline">\(T &gt; T_c\)</span>
the magnetic material will act paramagnetic, and will thus have no
hysteresis as B is swept. This is because the L function will only take
on the trivial solution for these temperatures<span
class="math inline">\(^{[9]}\)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="the-monte-carlo-method">The Monte-Carlo Method</h1>
<p>To solve this problem computationally, a Monte-Carlo solution is
employed. Essentially, the algorithm performs a small "nudge" on the
system and checks the energy. If the energy has decreased, then we have
gotten closer to the ground state, so the state is accepted. However,
even if the energy of the new state is greater than the old state, the
change is still accepted with a probability related to the temperature.
This is done in order to capture the temperature dependence of certain
variables in the system. The specific algorithm is called the
Metropolois Algorithm and is given below<span
class="math inline">\(^{[1]}\)</span>:<br />
1. Initialize a 2D array of atoms, each with a random free electron with
spin, <span class="math inline">\(s = [1,-1]\)</span>. The magnitude of
the spin dipole is ignored here, as we are only tracking the sign
difference between spins.</p>
<p>2. Randomly flip one of the spins in the array.</p>
<p>3. Check the total energy of the configuration. Again, only nearest
neighbors have to be checked for each spin. Additionally, periodic
boundary conditions are employed for the solid, for ease of programming.
Define <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E = E_{new} -
E_{old}\)</span></p>
<p>4. i. if <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E \leq 0\)</span>: keep
the change. This is more stable.</p>
<p>4. ii. else: accept the new configuration with a probability (given
by the Boltzmann distribution function, as this treatment is inherently
classical): <span class="math display">\[p(\Delta E) =
e^{\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_b T}\right)}\]</span></p>
<p>5. Replace old configuration with new one. Set <span
class="math inline">\(E_{old} = E_{new}\)</span>. Repeat steps 1-5 until
solution converges to a satisfactory state.<br />
Using algorithms like this, many problems in solid state physics can be
simulated to get reliable results. Of course, the main drawback of
simulating an entire solid becomes computational power. In the algorithm
just put forward, the number of computations needed for each time step
is at least <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> for an <span
class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> lattice. This quickly becomes
computationally intensive. The package Numba, and efficient programming
was used to partially alleviate time issues, but simulations still took
sometimes almost up to a minute.</p>
<h1 id="the-basic-case">The Basic Case</h1>
<p>Finally, a 2D square lattice was simulated. In this run, 1e6
timesteps were used on a 100x100 atom lattice. The magnetic field was
set to 5 Tesla, the exchange constant was set to <span
class="math inline">\(J = 0.00144\)</span> eV, and a value of <span
class="math inline">\(2\mu_b = 0.00011576\)</span> eV/T was used for the
Bohr magneton. The temperature was set to T = 20 K. An explanation of
these values will ensue later.</p>

</figure>
<p>What is interesting with this plot is the emergence of domains at
around the 10,000th timestep. Domains are favorable here because of the
exchange interaction between like spins. If there are going to be spins
aligned anti-parallel to the B field, they are going to at least be
grouped together, to minimize their energy.</p>
<p>The energy as a function of the number of Monte-Carlo time steps is
also plotted. We notice here that the energy quickly approaches its
minimum of -70eV after only about 125,000 timesteps, after which every
spin has flipped to align with the magnetic field, as we would expect
for a ferromagnet. Knowing how fast the solution will converge to a
stable state will be important later. Considering this is the most the
system can possibly be perturbed, most cases (such as varying T by a
small amount) will take many fewer steps than this to converge to the
ground state.</p>
<h2 id="curie-temperature">Curie Temperature</h2>
<p>Next, the dependence of the overall magnetization of the lattice on
the temperature was investigated. The magnetization M is calculated
as<span class="math inline">\(^{[6,9]}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M^* = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i s_i\]</span></p>
<p>where the total spin of the system is normalized with respect to the
number of members. Thus, if all the spins align with the magnetic field,
<span class="math inline">\(M^*=1\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">
<img src="4380/curieT.png" />
<figcaption>Magnetization of square lattice with respect to
T</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Temperature was then varied in the simulation, from T = 0 to 90 K.
Here, 2e6 timesteps were used on a 100x100 atom lattice. The magnetic
field was set to 0.5 Tesla, the exchange constant was set to <span
class="math inline">\(J = 0.00144/3\)</span> eV. These values gave the
best defined curve, Figure 3.</p>
<p>As we can see the material is mostly demagnetized around T = 30K and
higher. The decrease in magnetization reaches its halfway point at
around <span class="math inline">\(T_c = 25\)</span>K. The predicted
Curie temperature is <span class="math inline">\(T_c
\approx\frac{4J}{k_b}\)</span>K <span
class="math inline">\(=22.282\)</span>K, which is pretty close to what
was found. This is surprising, as these are somewhat random values for
this lattice.</p>
<p>In terms of implementing this calculation, the Curie temperature
calculation was actually written directly into the Metropolis algorithm.
The temperature was changed to a new value every time the algorithm was
ran 20,000 times, allowing it to fully converge for the new temperature.
Once the solution converged, the magnetization was recorded, and the
temperature was then updated.</p>
<h2 id="magnetization-hysteresis">Magnetization Hysteresis</h2>
<p>The response of the magnetization to a change in B field was also
analyzed. In theory, any ferromagnet with changing B field should
reproduce the curve in Figure 1, or the box like configuration
described. Thus, an attempt was made to recreate this curve.</p>
<p>To get a clean hysteresis curve, toy values of the constants were
chosen: J = 1eV, <span class="math inline">\(2\mu_b=2\)</span>eV/T.
Additionally the calculation was done on a <span
class="math inline">\(50\times50\)</span> lattice to save computation
time. The plots shown in Figure 3 were produced:</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">
<p><img src="4380/kbt=0.1.png" style="width:30.0%" alt="image" /> <img
src="4380/kbt=2.png" style="width:30.0%" alt="image" /> <img src="4380/kbt=5.png"
style="width:30.0%" alt="image" /> <img src="4380/para.png"
style="width:30.0%" alt="image" /></p>
<figcaption>Hysteresis plots of <span class="math inline">\(M^*\)</span>
vs B for varying temperatures.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Several really nice features were captured in these graphs. First of
all, the graphs match what theory tells us should happen, as in Section
2. Specifically, as the B field increases, the material starts from zero
magnetization, until it is fully magnetized. Then upon, bringing B back
down and past zero, the spins take an extra amount of energy to flip, as
they are already in a stable state due to the exchange constant biasing
them to point in the same direction. The same logic applies to the
reverse direction, with increasing B field. Another nice feature is the
emergence of paramagnetism at high temperature, and the overall
shrinking of the size, indicating that the Curie temperature is
somewhere around <span class="math inline">\(k_bT_c \approx
10eV\)</span>. In the 3D limit, ferromagnets act similar to this,
forming the basis for many memory storage applications.</p>
<h1 id="cri_3">CrI<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span></h1>
<p>Next, a real world material was modeled in an attempt to capture the
correct Curie temperature behavior. While ferromagnetism has been
observed in nature for centuries, a monolayer (2D) ferromagnet is a
recent experimental discovery, only occurring in 2017 <span
class="math inline">\(^{[2]}\)</span>. The first monolayer ferromagnet
to be found was CrI<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>. While 2D
magnets are theoretically prohibited due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem,
CrI<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>’s crystal structure
introduces a magnetic anisotropy to the Hamiltonian, which allows
CrI<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> to be a ferromagnet. The 2017
paper observed a Curie temperature of <span class="math inline">\(T_c =
45\)</span>K, and another later paper reported an exchange interaction
term of <span class="math inline">\(J = -1.44\)</span>meV, the basis for
the numbers in the first calculation<span
class="math inline">\(^{[3]}\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:4">
<figcaption>Crystal structure of CrI<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>. This figure is copyrighted so I took it out in this version.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first issue in modeling this was accounting for the honeycomb
lattice of CrI<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>, which was not
easy. The array involved in storing the states of every atom and all of
the functions that work with it had to be rethought. Another issue was
figuring out how to plot the array. Eventually a solution in which a
unit cell that tiled a hexagonal plane was found. Since every distance
in the monolayer honeycomb lattice is the same, this meant that the
actual energy calculation was not made that much more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-values">Experimental Values</h2>
<p>First, a simulation was run to ensure that the crystal lattice was
tiled correctly, and that the system was able to reach the ground state
magnetization. Chosen values were: 1000000 timesteps, B = 5T, and T =
20K and a lattice size of <span
class="math inline">\(25\times25\)</span>. While the lattice may appear
slightly squashed in the horizontal direction, this is only due to
python scaling each axis to the same length when plotting the data.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="curie-temperature-1">Curie Temperature</h2>
<p>Finally, the Curie temperature was estimated for CrI<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>. On a run with 2e6 timesteps, a <span
class="math inline">\(100\times100\)</span> lattice, and a field B = 5T,
the following plot was generated:</p>

<figcaption>Temperature dependence of <span
class="math inline">\(M^*\)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is really a phenomenal plot. While the Curie temperature appears
to be overestimated, the plot is really quite close, with a predicted
<span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> of around 50K, compared to the
experimentally reported value of 41K. This is quite unexpected, as the
spins are essentially being treated classically.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Overall, the Monte-Carlo solution for the 2D Ising model proved to be
moderately successful. While qualitative features of the Hysteresis plot
were nearly perfectly reproduced, the model struggled to achieve a
satisfying answer for the Curie temperature. Because the magnetization
didn’t transition to zero faster as temperature increased, getting an
accurate value for <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> was
difficult, and the reason as to why it transitioned so slowly is one of
the great mysteries of the code. Interestingly, the model seemed to
consistently overestimate the Curie temperature from what it should have
been. This seems to imply that the true minimum in energy was not found,
as the temperature should have been able to go lower before perturbing
the ordered ground state. One possible reason for this is that only
nearest neighbors were considered. In honeycomb lattices specifically,
the atoms that are not nearest neighbors could still have a significant
effect. In fact the exchange interaction term values for some
non-nearest neighbors are given in various papers, and could be the aim
of future code. With these terms added in, a fully magnetized material
would be able to achieve a lower energy, implying a lower Curie
temperature too in this model.</p>
<p>There are other possible effects causing error, too. First and
foremost this is a simplification of a much more complicated problem;
spin dipoles don’t simply point up or down, and this model hasn’t even
began to consider quantum effects. Furthermore, the CrI<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> molecule is not isolated in one place
in space, as it was modeled. Figure 5 clearly shows how the Iodine atoms
orient themselves in space, where electrons could also be localized.
Despite all this, the <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>
calculation’s were still fairly accurate. The prediction for <span
class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> for CrI<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> was within 10K of the correct
value.</p>

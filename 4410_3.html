<p>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is a key experimental method in condensed
matter and biochemistry, and the basis of MRI technology. In this study,
pulsed NMR techniques were used to generate spin echo signals from which
relaxation constants were calculated. Due to signal noise limitations,
methods robust against noise were developed. From these methods, the
magnetic moment of the proton was measured, <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_p = 1.416e-26 \pm 1.74e-29\)</span> J/T.
Further, relaxation constants for glycerin, water, and Copper Sulfate
from <span class="math inline">\(10^{17}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(10^{20}\)</span> ions/mL were measured, revealing
insights into the dependence of relaxation on viscosity and dissolved
ion concentration.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>Introduction</h1>
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance is a common experimental tool used to
study the internal structure of matter at a molecular level. The method
is used in fields ranging from condensed matter physics and the study of
strongly correlated electron systems, to biochemistry, where it can
determine the structure of biological macromolecules. Nuclear magnetic
resonance is also the fundamental mechanism behind magnetic resonance
imaging, or MRI’s, in clinical settings.</p>
<p>In principle, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) uses the interaction
between nuclear spins and applied magnetic fields. In a classic NMR
experiment, a material is placed in a strong magnetic field <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. Since the spins of the nuclei in the
material produce magnetic moments, <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\mu_p} = \gamma\vec{S}\)</span>, they will
feel a torque from an applied magnetic field, given by: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu_p}\times\vec{H}\]</span>
Owing to the common result in quantum mechanics, the spins will precess
about the magnetic field vector, say <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\hat{z}\)</span>, due to their uncertainty in
the two other spatial directions. The frequency of the spins precession
about the field <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is referred to
as the Larmor frequency. Next, a much smaller magnetic field, <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, is applied perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> (say in the <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{x}\)</span> direction), which oscillates in
time: <span class="math inline">\(\vec{H_1} =
H_1\cos(\omega_1t)\hat{x}\)</span>. A common trick to elicit the effect
of adding <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is to convert to a
rotating coordinate system, where the effective field felt by the spins
becomes<span class="math inline">\(^{[1]}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{H_{eff}} = (H_0 -
\frac{\omega}{\gamma})\hat{z} + H_1\hat{x}\]</span> Thus, if the
frequency of the RF field <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span>, is adjusted to the
correct value, it should cancel out the effect of the field <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. The spin of the nuclei will then
only feel the effect of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, and
due to the torque from equation one, will rotate about the <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{x}\)</span> axis.</p>
<p>This effect forms the basis of Pulsed NMR. Using pulsed NMR, it is
possible to measure the relaxation constants of a material. These time
constants can vary drastically across different parts of the human body,
enabling accurate imaging. Thus, accurately determining these constants
is very important, specifically to the technology of MRI. There are
three time constants of interest: <span
class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(T_2^*\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span>, the longitudinal relaxation time, is
the time constant associated with the spins in a system recovering to
their thermodynamic equilibrium after a perturbation, which is described
by the equation<span class="math inline">\(^{[1]}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[M_z(t) = M_0(1-\exp{(-\frac{t}{T_1}}))\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>, the transverse relaxation
time, is the time constant associated with how quickly a collection of
spin moments pointing in the same direction will spread out and
de-phase. This time can be difficult to measure, however, as
inhomogeneities in the static field <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> can cause bulk magnetization to
exponentially decay with a time constant smaller than <span
class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>. This observed decay time is deemed
<span class="math inline">\(T_2^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>Pulsed NMR, referring to the sending pulses of <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> as opposed to a continuous signal, is
the perfect experimental set up to measure these constants. Since the
application of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, oscillating at
the Larmor frequency, is able to rotate the spin vector about the x
axis, applying <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> for some time
<span class="math inline">\(t_w\)</span> will rotate the spins by an
angle, <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t) = \gamma H_1 t_w\)</span>.
In principle, this rotation should allow the determination of all
relaxation times, as it enables the disruption of a spin ensemble from
equilibrium, for measuring <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span>, and
studying how the spins de-phase as they rotate in the x-y plane, for
determining <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Specifically, <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span> were determined using the spin echo
effect, discovered by Erwin Hall in 1950. The technique used here to
generate a spin echo, diagrammed in Figure 1, utilizes a <span
class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span> and a <span
class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span> pulse, separated by a time
<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. First, the <span
class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span> pulse, a burst of the
oscillating <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> long enough to
rotate the spins by exactly <span
class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span>, tilts the spins into the x-y
plane, at which point they begin to de-phase. A time later, a <span
class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span> pulse is applied, which serves
to reflect the spins across the x-z plane. When this reflection happens,
the spins moments are reflected across the plane, but their frequencies
are not, causing the dephasing to “go backwards,” and the spins to
re-cluster at time <span class="math inline">\(2\tau\)</span>. It is
this re-clustering that causes the spin echo signal, measured using the
same coil that produced the <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>
burst. Hahn was later able to describe the functional form of the spin
echo from first principles<span class="math inline">\(^{[2]}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[V(t) =
M_0\sin(\omega_1t_w)\sin^2(\frac{\omega_1t_w}{2})\exp(-\frac{(t-\tau)^2}{2T_2^{*2}}-\frac{t}{T_2}-\frac{kt^3}{3})\]</span>
Where the new constant, k, encodes the effect of diffusion of molecules
throughout the liquid and becomes negligible for high viscosity
liquids.</p>
<p>The main goal of this experiment was to accurately determine the time
constants of several materials: glycerin, water, and Copper Sulfate in
concentrations ranging from <span class="math inline">\(10^{17}\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\(10^{20}\)</span> ions/mL. In each of
these compounds, the it was the spins of singular protons that were
studied. Using the above functional form, the time constants were
calculated from measurements of the spin echoes. Additionally, the
magnetic moment of the proton was estimated from measurements with
glycerin. Perhaps the main challenge of the experiment was dealing with
a set up with high static field inhomogeneity and inaccurate timing,
which is believed to be the cause of oscillatory modulations of the spin
echo signals shown in Figure 2:</p>

<figcaption>Spin echo signal after applying multiple <span
class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span> pulses after <span
class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span> pulse. This method of echo
generation is known as the Purcell method.<span
class="math inline">\(^{[3]}\)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It was found that changes in <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> as small as <span
class="math inline">\(10^4\)</span> Hz would be significant enough to
fully flip the sign of the spin echo equation modeled by Hahn. The
variance in frequencies was eventually measured to be 12.3KHz, well
within this range. Additionally, Hahn finds that the component of
magnetization that is measured has an additional term: <span
class="math inline">\(\cos(\Delta\omega t)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\omega = \omega_0 - \omega_1\)</span>,
representing how off resonance the <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> field is. Thus, for certain errors in
<span class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span>, an oscillatory modulation
of the magnetization should be observed. Finally, Hahn also describes a
scenario in which protons in the same molecule can have different Larmor
frequencies due the shielding from their local electron densities,
another possible cause of the modulated signal shown in Figure 3. The
methods presented in this study, though unconventional in the field of
pulsed NMR, are mostly robust to these effects, and may be desirable for
experimentalists with lower quality set ups.</p>
<h1 id="experimental-methods"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>Experimental Methods</h1>
<p>The physics set up used to collect spin echo signals consisted of an
Alpha model 7500 electromagnet connected to an Alpha model 7500PS DC
power supply and an AC line regulator. To get a signal, the current from
the power supply was turned slowly up to around 2.7 Amps, after which it
was allowed to cool for around an hour while the field stabilized. This
electromagnet provided the large <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> field, while a small coil, capable of
holding glass vials containing samples, provided the RF (radio
frequency) <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> field. The pulses
were generated using an Arduino, after which a frequency of 10 MHz was
generated over the pulses by the RF transmitter, which was driven by a
CTS MX0045 crystal clock oscillator. The signal was then sent through a
tuning circuit before being sent to the coil to drive <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>. Finally, the spin echo signals were
picked up from the coil and fed into a Picoscope 2204A, where data was
analyzed using the Picoscope T&amp;M 7 software.</p>

class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> field at the required frequency
pulse.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are three variables that need to be optimized in order to see a
maximal spin echo signal: the <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>
field strength, and the 90 and 180 degree pulse times. Since the most
sensitive of these is the <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>
strength, this was varied first, over a small range on the order of tens
of micro Amperes. The 90 and 180 times used for this step were estimated
from the field strengths of <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, using the equation, <span
class="math inline">\(t_\pi = \frac{H_0}{2H_1f}\)</span>, where f is the
Larmor frequency. Though an accurate measurement of the <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> field could not be made, it was found
to be at the largest <span class="math inline">\(10^{-4}\)</span> T,
which would place the optimal pulse lengths at around 50 and 100 <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>s for the <span
class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span> pulse lengths, respectively.
To more accurately optimize the pulse times, two methods were developed.
First, the times were simply randomly searched through to optimize the
spin echo. Second, a spin echo was actually observed after the
application of a 180-90 pulse sequence. As there is no <span
class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span> pulse to re-cluster the spins
in the x-y plane, with correct pulse times this echo should be
impossible. Thus, it was assumed that this was due to imperfect pulse
times, providing a simple way to optimize the pulse times: by
elimination of this spin echo. Complete elimination of this spin echo
proved impossible, though, likely due to timing inconsistencies in the
set up.</p>
<p>Next, the magnetic moment of the proton was estimated from a sample
of glycerin. As implied by Equation 2, the frequency of the RF <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> pulse that eliminates the z component
of the effective field will actually be the Larmor frequency, <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_0 = \gamma H_0\)</span>. Thus, simply
measuring the frequency of the <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>
pulse is enough to determine the proton moment. To do this, the input
signal was transformed using the Picoscope software, from which a
frequency and approximate measure of standard deviation was
calculated.</p>
<p>The measurement of the three time constants were performed by taking
traces of spin echo experiments with the Picoscope. For the measurement
of <span class="math inline">\(T_2^*\)</span> in glycerin, an average
over 500 waveforms was used to get a nice spin echo signal, from which a
full width half max was extracted using python, and used to calculate
<span class="math inline">\(T_2^*\)</span>. Likewise, for <span
class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span>, a large number of traces were
averaged together, while keeping tau constant at 1.5ms. The variable
altered between experiments was the time between different 90-180
sequences. For each time between sequences, T, the maximum value of the
averaged spin echo peak was extracted.</p>
<p>Estimates of <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span> suffered
greatly from the oscillatory modulation of the echo signal. To measure
<span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>, the time between <span
class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span> pulses, <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, was varied and the maximum value of
the spin echo at <span class="math inline">\(2\tau\)</span> was
recorded. Since the effect of the modulation was worse for larger tau,
some materials had to be manually analyzed. Instead of looking at the
average waveform, many waveforms were extracted. If the peak in the
region of the absolute value of the spin echo was larger than a
threshold of 0.2V (above the noise level), it was kept and averaged.</p>
<p>For estimations of <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>, Python was utilized to extract the
maximum value of each averaged waveform. The log of this maximum was
then plotted versus the two timescales varied, from which a linear or
cubic fit was created using linear regression. The uncertainty in the
estimate was extracted from the error in the estimate of the slope from
the linear regression, which was given systematic errors corresponding
to the noise of the system, <span class="math inline">\(\pm
0.097V\)</span>, as an input. Due to time limitations, only one curve
could be collected per sample.</p>
<h1 id="results-and-analysis">Results and Analysis</h1>
<p>First, the magnetic moment of the proton was calculated. As
mentioned, a measurement of the <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> driving <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> suffices to determine the Larmor
frequency. From the Larmor frequency, we can determine the proton moment
using the equations <span class="math inline">\(\mu_p = \gamma
\frac{\hbar}{2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma =
\frac{2\pi f}{H_0}\)</span>. The frequency of <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> was determined to be 10.00 MHz <span
class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 12.3KHz by using the fast Fourier
transform algorithm from the numpy package to extract a peak in
frequency. The error was estimated from the full width half max of the
peak. From this estimation, the proton moment was estimated to be <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_p = 1.416e-26 \pm 1.74e-29\)</span> J/T,
within 0.4% of the accepted value of <span
class="math inline">\(1.4106e-26\)</span> J/T.</p>
<p>Next, <span class="math inline">\(T_2^*\)</span> was calculated for
glycerin. Choosing a constant <span class="math inline">\(\tau =
2.0\)</span>ms for each pulse sequence, <span
class="math inline">\(T_2^*\)</span> was calculated from the variance of
a gaussian fitted to the spin echo curve, the functional form of which
is predicted by Equation 4.</p>

class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> used in this run, it is worth noting
the slight modulation at the edges of the gaussian, which may
effectively be shrinking the width of the gaussian, meaning the value
presented here may be an underestimate.</p>
<p>Next, <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> was estimated for
glycerin, water, and the four concentrations of Copper Sulfate by
varying the time, T, between spin echo experiments. Figure 5a shows the
spin echo amplitude for varying T, for glycerin and water. The values of
<span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> calculated for each material
are summarized in Table 1. The exponential plots qualitatively confirm
the exponential relationship of longitudinal relaxation presented in
Equation 3. Further, the difference in relaxation times between glycerin
and water reveals the strong effect of viscosity on spin coherence. For
higher viscosity materials, at a given temperature, the molecules will
have more rotational energy than translational, simply due to the
constraints from the high viscosity. It can be shown that the relaxation
rate <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> is minimized when the
frequency of the molecules rotation matches the Larmor frequency. As
viscosity increases, the molecular "tumbling" becomes more energetic,
and this condition gets closer to being satisfied, effectively
decreasing <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> with viscosity<span
class="math inline">\(^{[4]}\)</span>. The <span
class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> times for the various Copper Sulfate
concentrations likewise reveal the clear relationship between relaxation
times and the presence of paramagnetic ions. Copper ions, containing
unpaired electrons, will alter the local magnetic field due to the field
produced by the magnetic moment of the unpaired electron. These electron
moments will be oriented randomly due to thermal effects and molecular
motion. This alteration of the local field is enough to strongly perturb
the field around the two proton containing hydrogen atoms in water,
causing the proton’s spins collective motion to de-phase. Thus, for
higher Copper Sulfate concentration, the <span
class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> relaxation time would decrease, as
observed<span class="math inline">\(^{[5]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span> was measured for
all of the liquids, minus water. The maximum spin echo magnitude versus
time between <span class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span> pulses is plotted for glycerin
and the <span class="math inline">\(10^{17}\)</span> ions/mL Copper
Sulfate solution in Figure 5b. Much of the discussion on viscosity and
ion concentration applies to <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>
trends, as the de-cohering effects for bulk magnetization presented here
will cause disruption along all axis, whether in the x-y plane or not.
One important effect was the inclusion of the self diffusion constant,
k, that was necessary for to fit the data for the lowest Copper Sulfate
concentrations. For compounds with lower self diffusion, like glycerin,
this effect could be ignored, as Hahn did in his original 1950 work.
When self diffusion was sufficiently present, the log of the maximum
amplitudes was fit to a cubic function rather than a linear one. The
final calculated values are summarized in Table 1.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, despite high noise levels in the data collected, we
were able to develop methods to extract relaxation constants mostly
robust against noise. Through the course of this experiment, the
magnetic moment of the proton was determined from the driving frequency
of the <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> field to be <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_p = 1.416e-26 \pm 1.74e-29\)</span> J/T,
within 0.4% of the accepted value. Further, to our knowledge, accurate
estimate of the relaxation times of glycerin were recorded, along with
measurements of water and Copper Sulfate from <span
class="math inline">\(10^{17}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(10^{20}\)</span> ions/mL. The dependence of the
relaxation times on viscosity and dissolved ion concentration was also
found, from trends in the relaxation times between glycerin and the rest
of the samples, and the different Copper Sulfate concentrations. In
future iterations of the study, we plan to further study the effect of
viscosity on relaxation times using epoxy resin, which should change its
relaxation constants as it cures. Furthermore, we plan to investigate
the cause of the oscillatory echo modulation observed, as it remained
ambiguous.</p>

<p>P-n junctions form the foundation for much of modern electronics, due
to their highly nonlinear IV characteristics. Additionally, due to
electron-hole pair production, p-n junctions exhibit a voltage response
to incident light. In this report, the IV characteristics of a Germanium
p-n junction was measured, and the relationship of the photovoltage to
intensity of incident light was verified. Further, using semi-log
methods, the carrier lengths and lifetimes of electrons and holes were
estimated. Finally, also using semi-log methods, the quantity <span
class="math inline">\(e/k_b\)</span> was estimated to be <span
class="math inline">\(10937 \pm 23\)</span> V<span
class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>Introduction</h1>
<p>The p-n junction, commonly referred to as a diode, is a foundational
component of modern electronics. In principle, an ideal diode allows
current to flow in one direction through a circuit, but not another.
Although p-n junctions are not ideal diodes, their highly nonlinear
current voltage relationships closely approximate this property,
enabling them for use in computational settings, specifically as
components of transistors. Additionally, due to the IV relationships
dependence on temperature and illumination, p-n junctions can be used as
sensors, and are the fundamental building blocks in solar cell power
generation.</p>
<p>Semiconductors are materials with a small band gap of around 1-3 eV
between valence and conduction states of electrons, enabling a small
amount of conduction at room temperature. In most electronics
applications, semiconductors are doped with impurities. When doping
introduces an extra electron, the semiconductor is called n-type, and
when an extra spot in the valence shell for an electron is created, also
referred to as a hole, the semiconductor is called p-type. As an
example, Silicon, a semiconductor, could be doped with Phosphorus (on
the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^{13}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(10^{18}\)</span> P atoms<span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>cm<span
class="math inline">\(^{-3}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(10^{22}\)</span> Si atoms<span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>cm <span
class="math inline">\(^{-3}\)</span>)<span
class="math inline">\(^{[1]}\)</span>. Each Silicon atom has four
valence electrons, and bonds with four other Silicon atoms to form an
octet, such that each valence electron is in a bond. When Silicon is
doped with Phosphorus, the Phosphorus atoms each randomly replace one
Silicon atom, but end up leaving one valence electron unbonded, due to
Phosphorus possessing five valence electrons. Since the valence band of
pure Silicon is already filled, the added electron is free to conduct.
In reality, the extra electron forms a bound state with the Phosphorus
nucleus, but requires very little energy to be excited into
conduction.</p>
<p>A p-n junction is formed by placing a p-type semiconductor in contact
with an n-type semiconductor. What results is what is called a depletion
region at the interface of the two types, due to the loosely bound
electrons in the n-type semiconductor filling the empty valence spots on
the p-type side, states which are at a much lower energy. As shown in
figure 1n, the electrons leaving the n-type semiconductor leave behind
an extra proton, and the filled holes in the p-type region add an extra
negative charge. Thus, what results is a permanent charge imbalance, and
a voltage between the p and n regions.</p>

</figure>
<p>If a voltage difference is applied over the junction a current will
flow. Figure 1b models the band structure of the junction as a function
of space, where the difference in energy between the p and n regions is
due to the ambient induced voltage from the depletion region. There are
two processes that contribute to a voltage dependent current: the
movement of electrons in the n-type conduction band to the p-type
conduction band, and holes moving from the p-type valence band to the
n-type valence band. In each case, the difference in energy that the
carriers must traverse depends on the voltage applied across the
junction. The probability that any one carrier will make a transition to
another state is given by the fermi distribution function. At the
temperatures dealt with in this experiment, the function can be
approximated as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{-\frac{E-\mu}{k_bT}}+1}\approx
e^{-\frac{E-\mu}{k_bT}}\]</span></p>
<p>We take the probability of an electron making a transition from the
n-type to p-type semiconductor (and vice versa for holes) to be
proportional to the net current across the junction. After subtracting
out the process by which an electron in the p-type region is thermally
excited into the conduction band, and descends energetically into the
n-type region conduction band, we get the following current voltage
relationship, where <span class="math inline">\(J_s(T)\)</span>
represents the saturation current, and appears due to this
subtraction:<span class="math inline">\(^{[2]}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I =
J_s(T)(e^{-\frac{eV}{k_bT}}-1)\]</span></p>
<p>In this experiment, the photovoltaic effect was also investigated. If
light of high enough energy is shined upon a semiconductor, electrons
can be excited into the conduction band, creating a hole in the valence
band at the same time. Keeping in mind the band diagram in Fig 1b, these
excited electrons may diffuse towards the depletion region and into the
n-type region, which is lower in energy, and thus more favorable. The
same logic applies to holes in the reverse direction. The result is a
further build up of charge between two sides of the junction, and thus
an even larger voltage difference, called a photovoltage.<span
class="math inline">\(^{[3]}\)</span></p>
<p>In this report, a Germanium p-n junction was investigated. First, the
IV characteristics were measured, and shown to follow the relationship
previously described. Next, the existence of the photovoltaic effect was
verified, and a focused light beam was utilized to measure how far
electrons and holes are able to diffuse within the junction as well as
their lifetimes. Finally, using semi-log plot techniques, the IV curves
of another diode were used to estimate the quantity <span
class="math inline">\(e/k_b\)</span>, at several temperatures.</p>
<h1 id="experimental-methods"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>Experimental Methods</h1>
<h2 id="iv-curve"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>IV Curve</h2>
<p>The IV characteristics of a Germanium planar diode were measured. The
junction itself is mounted in an acrylic holder, such that the p and n
regions are both exposed to the ambient light of the testing room. The
holder itself has two possible connections over the junction: a direct
connection through a BNC, which was used to measure the voltage across
the junction with a Keithley 2110 Multimeter, and another that has two
300<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> resistors in series to
prevent large currents, which was used to gate the junction. A 1.5V
battery and a variable potentiometer was used to gate the junction at
varying voltages. In series with the potentiometer and the junction, the
current was measured using another Keithley 2110 Multimeter.</p>
<h2 id="the-photovoltaic-effect"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>The photovoltaic effect</h2>
<p>Next, the behavior of the junction under illumination was
investigated. First, the battery was taken out of the circuit, and the
potentiometer was set to one resistance (R = 137.9<span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>). A small white LED was mounted at
the same height as the planar junction, and driven by a 1Hz square wave
from a function generator. The amplitude of the function generator
signal was varied until the photovoltage over the junction was
maximized. Finally, the photovoltage was recorded at multiple distances
from the diode. A black piece of fabric was laid over the set up to
ensure that no ambient light influenced the results. Driving the LED at
1Hz gave the junction enough time to respond to the on and off states,
however, the value was still somewhat inconsistent. Thus, for each
distance, upper and lower voltages were recorded over 10 cycles after
which a mean change in voltage was calculated, with an associated
statistical error.</p>
<h2 id="calculation-of-carrier-diffusion-lengths-and-lifetimes"><span
id="sec:level1" data-label="sec:level1"></span>Calculation of carrier
diffusion lengths and lifetimes</h2>
<p>A reliable calculation of these constants requires very precise
focusing of light on the p-n junction. Thus, a focusing lens was placed
between the junction and the LED, and moved until as tight a beam as
possible could be made on the surface of the junction and the
photovoltage signal was maximized. Then, a Mitutyo micrometer was used
to adjust the perpendicular displacement of the diode with respect to
the light beam in successive steps of 0.325 and 0.3 mm. This way the
beam was able to scan across the p, the depletion, and finally the n
region. The data collection and circuit were otherwise unchanged from
the previous section.</p>
<h2 id="calculation-of-ek_b"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>Calculation of <span
class="math inline">\(e/k_b\)</span></h2>
<p>Finally, the constant <span class="math inline">\(e/k_b\)</span> was
estimated at several temperatures. To gain control over temperature, a
2N3053 NPN power transistor, immersed in mineral oil, was used instead
of the Germanium diode from before. The 2N3053 was essentially made to
be a p-n junction by shorting the collector and base, and measuring the
current and voltage between the base and emitter. Four IV curves were
recorded at 77K, 274K, 295K, and 373K. The 77K measurement was done
using liquid nitrogen, and was the only measurement to be done with a
different power transistor than the others, which was exposed directly
to the liquid nitrogen instead of being submerged in oil. The 274K
measurement was done in ice water, and the 373K was done on a hot
plate.</p>
<p>The collected data was processed using python and the scipy.optimize
package. Extraction of fundamental constants in the last two experiments
was done by taking the log of one of the parameters, and fitting the
data to a linear function using scipy. In all cases, the error of the
Keithley multimeters was found from a standard table published by the
company itself<span class="math inline">\(^{[5]}\)</span>. Given that
sometimes the devices seemed to be less accurate than the company
claimed, one half of the last reliable digit of each measurement was
added in quadrature to this value. This was considered the systematic
error. The error of fundamental constants calculated is given as one
value due to the fact that the error given to the scipy regression model
was the statistical and systematic error added in quadrature. The
regression then calculated an uncertainty in the constants based upon
both quantities.</p>
<h1 id="results-and-analysis">Results and Analysis</h1>
<p>First, the IV curve of the Germanium junction was characterized.</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">
<img src="Figure 2025-03-29 131636.png" style="width:80.0%" />
<figcaption>The IV curve of the Germanium p-n junction. The error bars
in I were scaled to make viewing easier by a factor of 20. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The results are plotted in Figure 2. Qualitatively, the curve matches
the common diode equation described earlier and in [2]. From the graph
we can estimate the saturation current to be around <span
class="math inline">\(J_s(T) \approx -0.0034\)</span> mA. While the
magnitude of this value is actually very large compared to existing
literature, this is likely due to the fact that these measurements were
not taken in a dark environment. A forward voltage is estimated to be
around 150 to 200mV.</p>
<p>Next, the response of the junction to illumination at different
distances was investigated.</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">
<img src="Figure 2025-03-29 133814.png" style="width:80.0%" />
<figcaption>The dependence of the photovoltage on the intensity of
incident light. The intensity varies with the inverse square of distance
from the sensor.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As described before, illumination of the p-n junction should result
in the diffusion of electrons and holes across the depletion region,
causing a photovoltage across the junction. Since the amount of light
incident on the junction will be directly proportional to the number of
electron hole pairs created, the intensity of the light should directly
correspond to the photovoltage measured. Since light intensity is
proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the source, the
photovoltage should also have this same dependence, which can clearly be
seen in Figure 3. Using regression, the data was fit to an inverse
square function, and found to have a reduced chi squared of about <span
class="math inline">\(X^2_{red} \approx 1.153\)</span>.</p>
<p>By changing the horizontal position of the junction and focusing the
LED, the diffusion lengths and lifetimes of both electrons and holes
were calculated.</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">
<img src="Figure 2025-03-29 134543.png" style="width:80.0%" />
<figcaption>A semi-log plot that was used to calculate the carrier
distances and lifetimes of electrons and holes. The region on the left
is the p-type region, while the region on the left is n-type, when
matched with known values. The a values are the slopes of the lines
fitted to each region.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As described by Goucher et al.<span
class="math inline">\(^{[6]}\)</span>, the diffusion of carriers, some
distance x from the depletion region of the device, to the other side of
the junction (the cause of the photovoltage), is proportional to
exp<span class="math inline">\((-x/L)\)</span>. Where L is the diffusion
length of the carrier, D is the diffusion constant, and tau is the
carrier lifetime. Given this relationship, we should expect the
photovoltage to increase exponentially as we approach the depletion
region of the junction, as more and more carriers will move across the
junction for smaller x. We also notice that the slopes of the P and N
regions–on the left and right respectively in Figure 4–are different,
implying that the lengths and lifetimes of electrons and holes are
different. In fact, the diffusion constants are different as well, <span
class="math inline">\(D_n = 43\)</span> cm<span
class="math inline">\(^2\cdot s^{-1}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(D_p = 92\)</span> cm<span
class="math inline">\(^2\cdot s^{-1}\)</span>. To extract the diffusion
lengths, we format the data in a semi-log plot, noticing that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_{ph} \propto e^{-\frac{x}{L}}\implies
ln(V_{ph}) \propto -\frac{x}{L}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the magnitude of the slope of the semi-log plot should be <span
class="math inline">\(1/L\)</span>. Fitting to this data with a linear
regression on the right and left sides of the junction, and solving for
the lifetimes using the equation <span class="math inline">\(L =
\sqrt{D\tau}\)</span>, the following values were obtained:. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
&amp; \textbf{P region} &amp; \textbf{N region} \\
\hline\hline
\text{Exp}&amp; L_p = 0.655 \pm 0.041 \text{mm}&amp; L_n = 0.492 \pm
0.028 \text{mm} \\
\hline
&amp; \tau_p = 46.6 \pm 5.8\mu s &amp; \tau_n = 56.3 \pm 6.4 \mu s\\
\hline
\text{Acc}&amp; L_p = 0.7\text{mm} &amp; L_n = 0.5\text{mm} \\
\hline
&amp; \tau_p = 52 \mu s &amp; \tau_n = 56 \mu s\\
\hline
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>The above table shows the experimental values were all nearly within
a standard deviation of the accepted result.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the deviation from the accepted values
may be that the errors in this experiment were too high. When converting
data to a log plot, the error of each data point also had to be
propagated, introducing a <span class="math inline">\(1/V_i\)</span> to
the ith error. Since the data furthest from the junction had such a
small photovoltage, this meant that the propagated error was very high,
possibly throwing off the regression.</p>
<p>Finally, the quantity <span class="math inline">\(e/k_b\)</span> was
calculated from several IV curves at different temperatures.</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">
<img src="Figure 2025-03-29 141655.png" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption>Semi-log plot of the IV curves for the 2N3053 at four
different temperatures. Of note is the large error bars for small I
values, a symptom of the error propagation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 5 shows a semi-log plot of the IV curves of the two 2N3053
power transistors at various temperatures. A semi-log plot is used for
the same reason as in the previous section: the diode equation is
exponential.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I\approx J\cdot e^{\frac{-eV}{k_bT}}
\implies Ln(I) \approx Ln(J) - \frac{eV}{k_bT}\]</span></p>
<p>Given this fact, the slope of the semi-log plot of the IV curves
should give us <span class="math inline">\(e/k_bT\)</span>. The slopes
were again estimated using linear regression, and then were multiplied
by the T of each curve to obtain an estimate for <span
class="math inline">\(e/k_b\)</span>, shown in the table below.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Temperature} &amp; \textbf{$e/k_b$} \\
\hline\hline
77 K&amp; 11028 \pm 7 \\
\hline
273K &amp; 11115 \pm 6 \\
\hline
295K &amp;  11056 \pm 10 \\
\hline
373K &amp; 10574 \pm 19\\
\hline
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>Averaging the four values together, we obtain a value of <span
class="math inline">\(e/k_b = 10937 \pm 23\)</span>. From this we can
see that our estimate for <span class="math inline">\(e/k_b\)</span>
varies from the accepted value of <span class="math inline">\(11064.9
\pm 0.6\)</span> 0 by 5.75<span class="math inline">\(\%\)</span>. All
valued are reported in units of inverse volts.</p>
<p>As can be seen in Figure 4, the IV curves of transistors diverged
from the expected exponential relationship for high and low values of
voltage. In reality, the diode equation breaks down at extremes due to
other effects contributing to the amount of current flowing, such as the
recombination current, or surface effects<span
class="math inline">\(^{[7]}\)</span>. In this study, the linear region
of the semi-log plot of the IV curve was simply found by visual
inspection (the linear region being where the junction follows the diode
equation most closely).</p>
<p>The fit for this plot suffered from the same issue of extremely high
errors for low current measurements as in the previous experiment, which
may have driven up the difference from the true value of e/k. The
estimates for e/k are consistently lower than expected, however,
suggesting the temperature could have been consistently lower than the
true value. What we believe is more likely is that surface effects,
which act to add an extra parameter m, called the ideality factor, have
become important in this case, which would account for a consistent
deviation from the expected value, though Inman et al. argues that power
transistors should not exhibit these defects. Of course there is also
the possibility that something else in the circuit also has a nonlinear
current voltage relationship, affecting the results.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The main aim of this project was to investigate the properties of p-n
junctions. First, a typical IV curve was measured for a planar Germanium
junction, which qualitatively matched the predicted relationship. Next,
the Germanium junction was illuminated with a white LED, which varied in
distance from the junction. A clear inverse square relationship measured
to high statistical confidence, as was expected. Using the same LED, a
focused beam of light was scanned across the p and n regions in order to
calculate the diffusion lengths and lifetimes of electrons and holes
from each of those regions, respectively. Finally, using a power
transistor in controlled temperature environments, the constant e/k was
calculated from the slope of the semi-log plot of the IV curve. Overall,
this study showcased the usefulness and complexity of the p-n junction.
Whether being used for energy generation in photovoltaic cells, or for
calculations of fundamental constants, the p-n junction is foundational
to modern electronics. In future iterations of the study, beyond
improvement of data acquisition techniques, we would hope to investigate
the photovoltaic effects dependence on frequency of incident light. By
varying the frequency, the exact value of the band gap of the doped
semiconductor could theoretically be measured.</p>

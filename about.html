    <p>Hi, my name is Finn and I just graduated from Cornell University with an Engineering Physics degree. 
        I am mainly interested in experimental condensed matter physics. For the past couple years I worked with the Ralph group in the physics department, where I focused on building 
        functioning Van der Waals heterostructures using sliding ferroelectrics, requiring experimental techniques such as E-beam lithography, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. 
        Additionally, I held a position as a researcher in the Barstow lab for several years working on engineering novel metabolic pathways into fast growing bacteria. Outside of work/school, 
        I love to watch movies, listen to music, and go running.

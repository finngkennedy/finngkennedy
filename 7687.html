<p>In this paper, the Haldane model is explained from first principles.
A simple graphene model is first investigated, after which a Hamiltonian
for the Haldane model is calculated. Using this Hamiltonian, expanded
about the K and K’ points of the Brillioun zone, and using the
approximation that most of the Berry curvature was localized around
these points, the Chern number was calculated for different parameter
combinations of the system.</p>

<p>June 2025 Note: I originally planned to include the Kane-Mele model in this paper,
  but ended up not having the time to write about it. Also I wasn't very happy with the explanations
  at the end of the paper. In the future I plan to come back here and edit this to
  add Kane-Mele and expand basically every part but I need to do some review first.

<h1 id="introduction"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the previous 30 years it have become increasingly clear that
topology is a necessary tool for understanding condensed matter systems.
An elegant example of a system exhibiting nontrivial topological effects
without the addition of an external magnetic field is the Haldane model,
first proposed by Duncan Haldane in 1988. This model showed that a
two-dimensional crystal can exhibit a quantized Hall conductance, or the
quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAH), purely due to the lattice geometry
and local time-reversal symmetry breaking, rather than through an
externally applied magnetic field.</p>
<p>The Haldane model itself is an elaboration on the tight binding model
for a simple honeycomb lattice. It consists of the nearest-neighbor (NN)
real hopping term, present in the original model, and a
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) complex hopping. The complex phase added on
mimics the effect of a staggered magnetic field that has no net flux per
unit cell. This breaks time-reversal symmetry locally, but preserves
translational symmetry. Importantly, this leads to a band structure that
is gapped at the K and K’ points of the lattice, unlike in the original
model. But, for certain values of the NNN hopping term, and another
added mass-like term, the gap can actually be closed, causing a band
inversion. It is at band inversions like these that topologically
interesting phenomena occurs, and in this case, it gives rise to a Berry
phase which implies a nonzero Chern number. The presence of this
nontrivial topology manifests itself in edge states that give rise to a
quantized Hall conductivity <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{AH} =
C\frac{e^2}{h}\)</span>, where C is the integer valued Chern number. The
Haldane model serves as an important theoretical model for understanding
the calculations of Berry curvature, Chern numbers, and bulk-boundary
correspondence.</p>
<p>To this day, the Haldane model remains an important model in the
field of condensed matter. The model laid the groundwork for making
experimental predictions about Chern insulators, and provided the tools
necessary for later models, such as the Kane-Mele model, which
investigated the addition of spin to the Haldane model, and was the
basis for the prediction of the quantum spin Hall effect. Numerous
computer programs have additionally been developed for the model, due to
the difficulty of doing many of the calculations without severe
approximation.</p>
<h1 id="the-haldane-model"><span id="sec:level1"
data-label="sec:level1"></span>The Haldane Model</h1>
<p>As mentioned, the Haldane model was the first model to explicitly
derive a mechanism for the quantum anomalous hall effect (QAH). The key
insight into recovering the QAH effect was the introduction of a
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping term into the Hamiltonian, which in
this case was defined on a honeycomb lattice. First, we review the
Hamiltonian and band structure of the honeycomb lattice, which will give
us insights into how the Haldane model operates.</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">
<img src="7687/image.png" style="width:50.0%" />
<figcaption>Honeycomb lattice. In this work I renamed the a vectors to
<span class="math inline">\(\delta_i\)</span>. Reproduced from
[3].</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The honeycomb lattice is first defined with the following
vectors:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{a_1} = (1,0)\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\vec{a_2} =
(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\vec{a_3} =
(-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\]</span></p>
<p>The vectors <span class="math inline">\(\vec{a_i}\)</span> represent
the lattice basis vectors, while the vectors <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\delta_i}\)</span> represent the displacement
vectors from an atom in sub lattice A from all three nearest neighbors
in sub lattice B, and vice versa. We can additionally get the Bravais
lattice vectors of the system, which can be used to define the K and K’
points, <span class="math inline">\(K =
(\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3\sqrt{3}})\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(K&#39; =
(\frac{2\pi}{3},-\frac{2\pi}{3\sqrt{3}})\)</span>. The most elegant way
to solve this problem is done in the following way. We can define the
total wavefunction in momentum space as the sum of the momentum space
wavefunction for sub lattices A and B, where N is the total number of
unit cells in the crystal.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ket{\psi_k} = \alpha\ket{A_k} +
\beta\ket{B_k}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ket{A_k} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{\vec{R}}e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{R}}\ket{A_{\vec{R}}}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\ket{B_k} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{\vec{R}}e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{R}}\ket{B_{\vec{R}}}\]</span></p>
<p>We further assume that the onsite energy of every A and B atom is
zero, meaning that: <span class="math inline">\(\braket{A_R | \hat{H} |
A_R} = 0\)</span>, and likewise for atoms in the B sub lattice. We
introduce the nearest neighbor hopping term <span
class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> as the following...</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\braket{A_{\vec{R}+\vec{\delta_i}} |
\hat{H} | B_{\vec{R}}} = -t_1\]</span></p>
<p>and likewise for the opposite combination of states. This statement
essentially expresses that there is a non-zero overlap in energy between
the nearest neighbor lattice sites. We are interested in the Hamiltonian
in momentum space, so we can solve for it using the state expressed in
this space. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \braket{A_k | \hat{H} | B_k} =
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{\vec{R},\vec{R&#39;}}e^{i\vec{k}(\vec{R}-\vec{R&#39;})}\\\times\braket{A_{\vec{R&#39;}}
| \hat{H} | B_{\vec{R}}}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{\vec{R},\vec{R&#39;}}e^{i\vec{k}(\vec{R}-\vec{R&#39;})}(-t_1)(\delta_{\vec{R&#39;}-(\vec{R}
+ \vec{\delta_i})})\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{\vec{R}}(-t_1)(e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{\delta_i}})\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[=-t_1f(k)\]</span></p>
<p>Where in the second and third steps there is an implied sum over all
of the delta basis vectors, and the final complex function is simply
written as <span class="math inline">\(f(k)\)</span>. We can similarly
show that expectation values taken between states on the same lattice
will be zero. This is because of the <span
class="math inline">\(\bra{A_{R&#39;}}\hat{H}\ket{A_R} = 0\)</span> term
which will appear in the sum, that will always be zero no matter the
displacement between neighboring A atoms, and likewise for atoms on the
B sub lattice.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian of the system can then be written in matrix form:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H(\vec{k}) =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -t_1f(k) \\
-t_1f^*(k) &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we get an energy relation, which is
captured in the famous band diagram:</p>
<figure id="fig:enter-label">

style="width:70.0%" />
<figcaption>The band diagram of graphene in the simple model. Adapted
from [3].</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the Haldane model, two more terms are introduced. First, a term to
introduce a difference in energy between the A sub lattice and the B sub
lattice, M. Second, the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping effect is
introduced, with strength <span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span>. The
Hamiltonian is given below in the second quantized notation [2].</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H = M \sum_i (-1)^{\tau_i} c_i^\dagger c_i + t_1 \sum_{\langle i,j
\rangle} (c_i^\dagger c_j + h.c.) \\
+ t_2 \sum_{\langle\langle i,j \rangle\rangle} (ic_i^\dagger c_j + h.c.)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Here, the <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> operators
represent the fermionic creation and annihilation operators at all
sites, numbered through i and j. The variable <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_i\)</span> is simply either one or two
depending on which sub lattice is being described. Finally, the NNN term
describes how the wavefunction picks up a phase of +i as it hops between
next nearest neighbors in the forward direction. In the original Haldane
model paper this term was left as some ambiguous phase <span
class="math inline">\(e^{i\phi}\)</span>, but here the simpler case is
treated. Importantly, this term breaks time reversal symmetry (TRS), as
complex conjugation would flip the sign of the i in the NNN term. This
Hamiltonian can be written in the same form as for the normal honeycomb
lattice:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H(\vec{k}) = h_0(\vec{k}) + M\sigma^z +
2t_2\sum_i\sigma^z\sin(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{d})
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the new set of vectors <span class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span>
have been introduced to represent the distances between nearest
neighbors of the same sub lattice A or B. Since the important
topological effects will happen around Dirac cones in the band structure
at the K and K’ points, the Hamiltonian is expanded about these points
as <span class="math inline">\(\vec{k} = \vec{K} + \vec{q}\)</span>.
Considering q negligible in the sin term...</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H(\vec{k}) =
\begin{pmatrix}
M + 3\sqrt{3}t_2 &amp; -t_1f(\vec{K} + \vec{q}) \\
-t_1f^*(\vec{K} + \vec{q}) &amp; -M - 3\sqrt{3}t_2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The off diagonal terms of the matrix are intentionally left
un-simplified as at the K and K’ points these will go to zero. The
important physics occurs due to the diagonal terms. The total energy for
the valence and conduction bands will thus be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \pm (M +
3\sqrt{3}t_2)\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the band structure of the Haldane model is essentially the same
as for the simple graphene model presented before, but with a band gap
at the K and K’ points caused by the new terms introduced. For the K’
point the relation is essentially the same apart from the <span
class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> term acquiring a minus sign. The
important feature of this Hamiltonian is what happens when <span
class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> is varied such that the energy flips
sign. When the energy flips sign, the lower energy term of the
Hamiltonian (already diagonalized in the sub lattice A and B basis), or
the lower band, will be entirely localized on one of the sub lattices.
Because of the different energies at the K and K’ points, it is possible
that the valence band could be localized on A at one of these points,
but at B at the other. This character of the valence band does require a
band inversion, or a case where the band gap energy goes to zero.</p>
<p>In principle, we can now calculate the Chern number, which will
reveal the importance of the topology of the band structure. To do this,
we can note that the Berry curvature around the K and K’ points
approaches a delta function as the band gap closes for changing <span
class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span>. Due to this fact, we can simply
calculate the Berry curvature from the Hamiltonian we expanded about
these two points, as this approximation should capture almost all of the
curvature. To do this, we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian given earlier,
and extract eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(\ket{u_-}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\ket{u_+}\)</span>, corresponding to the
states in the valence and conduction bands. The Berry curvature then
becomes [2]:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\omega^-(k) =
\partial_{k_x}\bra{u_-}\partial_{k_y}\ket{u_-} -
\partial_{k_y}\bra{u_-}\partial_{k_x}\ket{u_-}\]</span></p>
<p>We can show that for some small region <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda = |\vec{q}|\)</span> this equals:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\omega^-(k) = \frac{M +
3\sqrt{3}t_2}{2((M + 3\sqrt{3}t_2)^2 + q_x^2+q_y^2)^{3/2}}\]</span></p>
<p>At this point we can integrate to get the Chern number of the lower
band as a function of the sign of the energy term. Here we note that,
since almost all of the Brillioun zone will have zero curvature, the
integral is taken in the only approximately non-zero region of <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C =
\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{BZ}d^2k(\omega^-(k))\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[C = \pi sign(M + 3\sqrt{3}t_2)\]</span></p>
<p>This result will be true up to some correction due to the delata
function approximation. To get the full Chern number, we have to add up
the contributions of the K and K’ points. For different values of M and
<span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span>, the results of the Chern
number integral at K and K’ will either sum or cancel. There exist two
regions in this parameter space where the Chern number is nonzero.</p>
<p>The nonzero Chern number found here is important in that it gives
rise to the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This result can be formally
proven with linear response theory, as in [2], however, the result is
stated here:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_{AH} =
C\frac{e^2}{h}\]</span></p>
<p>The bulk properties of the insulator are able to generate edge modes
that generate the responses required for this Hall effect. The basis of
these edge modes stems from single crossings of states from the valence
bands to the conduction bands, and vice versa [1].</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, the Haldane model was shown to exhibit interesting
topological properties, which give rise to the quantum anamolous Hall
effect. To build up this model, a regular model of graphene was first
employed and solved, which was shown to have no band gap whatsoever.
Then, after introducing a site dependent energy, M, and a
next-nearest-neighbor hopping term that broke time reversal symmetry,
the Haldane model was shown to exhibit a changing Chern number based on
the varying of these parameters. In the much simplified case of being
near band inversion, where the Berry curvature was assumed to be
localized almost entirely at the K and K’ points, in what are
essentially delta functions, the Chern number was solved for by
integrating the calculated Berry Curvature over a small region deemed to
sufficiently capture the Berry curvature. Using this method, we were
able to recapture the <span class="math inline">\(Z_1\)</span> index
that describes the topology of this band structure. This topology is
important in that it gives rise to dissipation less edge states,
described by band crossings. Another model that took Haldane’s model one
step further was the Kane-Mele model, which introduced electron spins
into the Hamiltonian. Importantly, this model found that the two spin
states could essentially be described as decoupled; that the model could
be thought of as two Haldane models with opposite spin, giving rise to
the idea of the Kane-Mele model having a <span
class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> topological index. This model was
able to provide a theoretical prediction of the quantum spin Hall
effect. In future papers, we plane to explore this model more.</p>
